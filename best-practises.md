# Best Practices

1. order imports at top of files into groups or related imports and alphabetically within groups
 - angular e.g. core, forms etc.
 - rxjs 
 - ngrx
 - models
 - actions
 - reducers
 - selectors
 - utils

2. Store as much state in the store and as little in the component
3. Make actions as consistent as possible.
