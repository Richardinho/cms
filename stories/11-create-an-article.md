# Create an Article

As a user, I want to be able to create an article and save it into the database

* GIVEN the user is within the app
* WHEN the user clicks a 'create article' button
* THEN an empty editor pane should open

* GIVEN the editor pane is open
* WHEN the user inputs Markdown text into the editor pane
* THEN the formatted version of the article should be shown in a viewer pane

* GIVEN the editor pane is open
* AND the user has written Markdown text in the editor pane
* WHEN the user clicks the 'save' button
* THEN the article should be saved in the database
