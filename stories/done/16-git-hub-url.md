# 16. As a user, I want to be able to set the Git Hub Url
The website displays a link to the Github repository. This link should be obtainable via the API and able to be set in the CMS

There should be a metadata page for setting config data like this
There should be a link in the navigation bar to this page
On this page should be a field for setting the github link
