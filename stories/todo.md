# I want to be able to: 
* 02. set the number of article links on different pages
* 03. upload images to my CDN
* 05. use the app on a mobile device
* 08. enable/disable comments
* 15. set the email address
* 16. set the GitHub url
* 21. show dates on article. Date of creation and date of last edit
* 22. show name of author on article. (obviously will always be me, but just to make that explicit)
* 22. show name of author on article. (obviously will always be me, but just to make that explicit)


## Done
* 01. set the tags on an article (e.g. HTML, JS etc.)
* 06. warned if I try and navigate away from a page while I have unsaved changes
* 07. access the site only if authorised
* 09. delete an article from view article page
* 10. publish an article
* 11. create an article
* 12. edit an article
* 13. view an article
* 14. unpublish articles
* 17. Logout
* 19. delete button on edit page
* 20. Create home page link in header bar

## Bugs
* visited links have default color. Should be custom color.
* When on edit article page and you time out with unsaved changes, when you return to the page after logging in, the save button should be active.
