# Story 18: Delete Article buttons on Home Page

As a user, I want to be able to delete articles from the home page

**GIVEN** the user is on the home page<br/>
**WHEN** they click on a delete button on an article link<br/>
**THEN** a confirm modal should pop up asking if they are sure that they want to delete the article<br/>

**GIVEN** a confirm delete modal is being displayed<br/>
**WHEN** the user clicks *yes*<br/>
**THEN** the article will be deleted<br/>
**AND** the pop up will disappear<br/>
**AND** the link will no longer be shown<br/>

**GIVEN** a confirm delete modal is being displayed<br/>
**WHEN** the user clicks *no*<br/>
**THEN** the pop up will disappear<br/>
